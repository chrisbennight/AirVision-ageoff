#AirVision Ageoff script

Usefull against V1.X of Ubiquity's AirVision Surveillance sotware.  The system does not provide a way to delete recordings older than a fixed period.  Scripts which delete the files persisted on disk miss database references.  This script uses the Ubiquity API to delete files the same way a user would.
